      <i
        >“What makes Core Java the definitive work on the language is more than
        its vast scope—it is the quality of the presentation.”</i

      <i
        >“Cornell and Horstmann make the details of this powerful and expressive
        language understandable, and they also furnish a conceptual model for
        its object-oriented foundations.”</i
      >
      —Grady Booch.

      <i
        >“Devoid of shaky, academic examples and packed with robust
        demonstrations that illustrate hundreds of powerful concepts...The
        authors back up the many examples with sharp, fact-rich commentary on
        how to get things done with Java.”</i
