    <h1>Stratovolcanoes</h1>
    <p>
      Strato Volcanoes comprise the largest percentage (~60%) of the Earth's
      individual volcanoes and most are characterized by eruptions of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andesite" target="_blank"
        ><i>andesite</i></a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacite" target="_blank"
        ><i>dacite</i></a
      >
      - lavas that are cooler and more viscous than basalt. These more viscous
      lavas allow gas pressures to build up to high levels (they are effective
      "plugs" in the plumbing), therefore these volcanoes often suffer explosive
      eruptions.

      Left: This is a schematic diagram of a strato volcano, intended to
      illustrate the different layers of different materials that comprise them.
      The purple colors are meant to represent
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ash" target="_blank"><i>ash</i></a>
      layers, either the products of fall-out from big eruption clouds or the
      products of pyroclastic flows. Notice that these ash layers tend to be
      thin but widespread. The orange colors represent lava flows, and note that
      some of them have cinder cones associated with them at the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano" target="_blank"
        ><i>vent</i></a
      >. The green colors are meant to represent lava domes, and notice that
      they do not flow very far. Each eruption, regardless of what it produces,
      is fed from the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magma%20chamber" target="_blank"
        ><i>magma chamber</i></a
      >
      by a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology)" target="_blank"
        ><i>dike</i></a
      >. Most dikes come up through the center of the volcano and therefore most
      eruptions occur from at or near the summit. However, some dikes head off
      sideways to feed eruptions on the flanks.

      Right: This is a pit that has been dug into the ground at Cotopaxi, a big
      strato volcano near Quito, the capital city of Ecuador. The pit is about 2
      meters deep and in it you can clearly see a number of ash layers exposed.
      It is also easy to see that the layers are different - some are coarse and
      others are fine, some are dark-colored and others are light-colored.

      The lava at strato volcanoes occasionally forms
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a'a" target="_blank"><i>a'a</i></a
      >, but more commonly it barely flows at all, preferring to pile up in the
      vent to form volcanic domes. Some strato volcanoes are just a collection
      of domes piled up on each other. Strato volcanoes are commonly found along
      subduction-related volcanic arcs, and the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magma" target="_blank"
        ><i>magma</i></a
      >
      supply rates to strato volcanoes are lower. This is the cause of the
      cooler and differentiated magma compositions and the reason for the
      usually long
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano" target="_blank"
        ><i>repose</i></a
      >
      periods between eruptions. Examples of strato volcanoes include Mt. St.
      Helens, Mt. Rainier, Pinatubo, Mt. Fuji, Merapi, Galeras, Cotopaxi, and
      super plenty others.
